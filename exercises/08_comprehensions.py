"""
Create a list of words and with it, create a new dictionary
in which the key is the word and the value is the same word
reversed.

"""
Let's try this one again:

Using the range function, create a sequence of numbers
from 1 to 100, and using the comprehension to return only
those that are multiplies of 2.
"""


"""
[[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8]]

Use the list above and create nested comprehensions so that
the final value is a new list like the following

[[2, 4, 6, 8], [10, 12, 14, 16]] The number multiplied by 2
